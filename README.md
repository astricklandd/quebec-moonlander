Dev Lab QUEBEC

User Story (ðŸ‘• large):

As an individual dev

I want to demonstrate a full stack data round trip

So that I am qualified to work on a capstone dev team (and get an awesome job)
***

Narrative
- Do the same stuff in Papa: CRUD.
- Except this time, your VIEW (front end) is on our class repo: [https://github.com/barrycumbie/laughing-sniffle] (https://github.com/barrycumbie/studious-robot)
- Make sure you use SECRETS to not expose any db credentials

Min Acceptance Critera
- A complete, verbose PR to our REPO, all conflicts resolved.
- When I merge it, I can navigate to your page (make sure you tell me) to see a demo of a data full stack trip
